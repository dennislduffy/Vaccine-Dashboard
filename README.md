# Vaccine-Dashboard

This is a mockup of a vaccine dashboard, similar to the types of dashboards being developed as states distribute the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccination data is based on publicly available data posted by the Minnesota Department of Health. The data for this particular mockup was accessed on September 17th, 2021 from https://mn.gov/covid19/assets/People%20Vaccinated%2C%20By%20County_tcm1148-467651.csv. Data on doses administered per week can be found at https://mn.gov/covid19/assets/Doses%20Administered%20By%20Week_tcm1148-462844.csv. 

Minnesota population numbers are from https://mn.gov/admin/assets/mn_county_estimates_sdc_2019_tcm36-442553.xlsx.

This dashboard was built in R using R markdown and the flexdashboard package. The interactive time-series graph is built using plotly and ggplot. The interactive choropleth map is built using the Leaflet library.
